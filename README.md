# Web-based-system-for-traking-students-exam-marks-with-a-login-service

**:
So basically, I hosted this web based system on an Ubuntu Server image on Virtual box using Apache server. I've used PHP for server side verification and functionality, Javascript for some client side verification, MySQL database management system for storing the data, HTML and some PHP for the webpages.
Basically the LAMP(Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack.

**Working:
Atleast one faculty should be added into the database manually, so that this faculty can verify the other faculties and students who signup through the website.
After that, other faculties and students can signup and the already verified faculty can verify those whose signup requests are pending.
Students and faculties who have signed up through the website cannot login/signin until they are verified by the faculty that is already verified (i.e. the ones in the database).

index.html is the main page.

I'll add the database schemas shortly.

You'll have to change the file paths wherever necessary.
